2. Language Detect: returns the name of the language that the string is written in
3. Tokenize: tokenizes the string
4. Top Ten: returns a list of up to ten of the most frequently used words
5. Part of Speech Tagging: assigns each word in the string to a part of speech
6. English to French: translates the string from English to French
7. English to Chinese: translates the string from English to Chinese
8. Spell Check: Returns spelling errors (if any)


Instructions
------------
Launch your AWS instance and connect to your running instance via your terminal.
After installing git and python3, and using git clone to clone the repository to your terminal,you will need to install the requirements of the flask api prior to running the script itself.

NOTE: While most of the required packages to run this script have been placed on a 'requirements.txt' page, there is a subfolder titled 'materials' that contains several additional packages that must be manually installed by accessing the file path directory. Once this has been completed, the flask api.py file will run successfully.
